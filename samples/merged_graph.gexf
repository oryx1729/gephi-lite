Expenses were up 11% year on year, largely due to higher compensation and the impact of strategic acquisitions like JP Morgan Asset Management China. AWM recorded net long-term inflows of $12 billion for the quarter and $140 billion for the full year, with record client asset net inflows of $489 billion for the year, bringing AWM to $3.4 trillion and client assets to $5 trillion, both up 24% year on year.&quot;&#10;&quot;AWM refers to an organization managing assets with a total of $3.4 trillion, experiencing a 24% increase year on year due to net inflows and higher market levels.&quot;&#10;&quot;AWM is highlighted for its continued client advisor hiring and support for advisors and clients, indicating its role in driving volume and revenue.&quot;&#10;&quot;AWM refers to a part of the organization with volume and revenue-related drivers tied to an improved revenue outlook.&quot;" />
